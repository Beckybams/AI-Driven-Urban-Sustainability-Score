AI-Driven-Urban-Sustainability-Score
📘 Overview

The AI-Driven Urban Sustainability Score project leverages artificial intelligence and data analytics to evaluate and score the sustainability performance of cities. It integrates data across environmental, social, and economic indicators to provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and sustainability experts.

🚀 Key Features

🌍 Comprehensive Scoring System — Evaluates cities based on multiple sustainability dimensions.

🤖 AI-Powered Insights — Uses machine learning models to analyze urban data and predict sustainability trends.

📊 Dynamic Visualization — Presents sustainability metrics in clear and interactive formats.

🏙️ Synthetic Dataset — Uses generated data for experimentation and model testing.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Machine Learning Algorithms (Regression, Clustering)

Excel/CSV for Data Export

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

⚙️ How It Works

Data Generation: Synthetic urban data is created for multiple cities.

Feature Analysis: Environmental, social, and economic factors are analyzed.

Model Training: AI algorithms predict sustainability scores.

Output: Results are exported to Excel for visualization and reporting.

📈 Example Indicators

Air Quality Index (AQI)

Waste Recycling Rate (%)

Public Transport Accessibility

Renewable Energy Usage (%)

Green Space per Capita (m²)

Economic Equality Index

🧾 Output Example
City	Air Quality	Renewable Energy (%)	Green Space	Score
City A	75	45	28	82
City B	60	30	22	71
💡 Future Improvements

Integration with real-world city datasets (UN, World Bank).

Development of an interactive dashboard.

Incorporation of satellite and IoT data sources.
